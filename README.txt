Here is a small Python module for the PiGlow addon by Pimoroni, it will let you flex the LED muscles of this fantastic addon.

File list:
  
  piglow.py - Python module you'll import into your script


  all.py - This will increase then decrease all the LEDs together

  cycle.py - This will cycle the colours together from center to the end back to the center

  indiv.py - Quickly increase and decrease the LEDs independantly

  test.py - You choose the brightness of each LED colour group, to see how it will look



The functions of piglow are:




  from piglow import PiGlow

  piglow = PiGlow([0/1])



  piglow.white([0-255])

  piglow.blue([0-255])

  piglow.green([0-255])

  piglow.yellow([0-255])

  piglow.orange([0-255])

  piglow.red([0-255])

  piglow.all([0-255])

  piglow.led([0-17],[0-255])

  piglow.led1-led18([0-255])





All colours are from 0 (off) to 255 (super duper eye numbing bright!)


Enjoy!
